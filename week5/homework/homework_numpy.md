# Homework — Numpy basics

Note: use google or ChatGPT to lookup things

## 🧩 Task 1: Creating Arrays

Import NumPy.

Create a NumPy array with the numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20.

Print the array.

Print the type of the array.


## 🧩 Task 2: Indexing and Slicing

Create this numpy array:

[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]


Print:

The first element

The last element

The middle two elements

Change the value 8 to 100.

Print the updated array.

## 🧩 Task 3: Basic Math Operations

Create this numpy array:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Multiply all values by 2.

Add 10 to each value.

Subtract 1 from each value.

Print the final array.

## 🧩 Task 4: Simple Statistics

Create an array with at least 5 numbers.

Calculate and print:

Sum

Mean

Minimum

Maximum

## 🧩 Task 5: Comparing Values

Create a numpy array:

[3, 7, 1, 9, 4]


Create a new array that shows whether each number is greater than 5.

Print both arrays.


## 🧩 Task 6: Using reshape

Create an array with numbers from 1 to 12.

Reshape it into a 3 × 4 matrix.

Print the result.


## 🧩 Task 7: Matrix Multiplication

Objective: Learn how to multiply matrices using NumPy.

Tasks:

Import NumPy.

Create two matrices:

A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

B = np.array([[5, 6],
              [7, 8]])


Print both matrices.

Multiply the matrices using:

np.dot(A, B) or

A @ B

Print the result.

Print the shape of the resulting matrix.

Bonus:

Try multiplying in the reverse order (B @ A).

Compare the results and explain what you observe.
