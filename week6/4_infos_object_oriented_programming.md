# Object oriented programming

### What is Object Oriented Programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects — self-contained units that bundle data (attributes) and the behaviors that act on that data (methods) — so you can model real-world concepts and structure code in modular, reusable pieces. This approach makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

Some key principles are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation in object-oriented programming means bundling an object’s data (attributes) together with the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class), while hiding the internal details so outside code can only interact through a defined interface — this protects the object’s state and makes code easier to maintain and use.

### What is abstraction?
Abstraction in object-oriented programming means hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or behaviors you need to use an object, so you can work with higher-level concepts without worrying about how they’re done behind the scenes.

### What is inheritance?
Inheritance in object‑oriented programming is the mechanism where a new class (child/subclass) automatically gets the attributes and methods of the parent class, letting you reuse and extend code and form natural hierarchies between classes.

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism in object‑oriented programming means that the same operation (like a method call) can work on different types of objects and each object can respond in its own way, so you can use a common interface while the actual behavior depends on the specific class of the object. 

For example, if you have a base class Shape with a method `draw()`, then `Circle`, `Square`, or `Triangle` objects can each implement their own version of `draw()` and the correct one will be called even when you treat them all simply as Shape objects.
