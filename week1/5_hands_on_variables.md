# Variables

Variables are typically defined in Python with the **snake case** convention (left column):

There are also other conventions, see table.

## Tasks
### 👨‍💻 TASK 1: Naming convention

Create four variables with the snake case convention, each with a different data type:
- A string to store your name.
- An integer to store your age.
- A boolean to store whether you are a student.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 2: Variable assignment

Define the variables:
```
>>> account_owner_name = None
>>> account_owner_age = None
>>> is_account_owner_student = None
```

Assign the variables define in Task 1 to this variables.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 3: Python variables are dynamically typed
Define the variables and print types:
```
>>> age = 25
>>> name = "Ahmad"
>>> weight = 82.0
>>> type(age)
>>> type(name)
>>> type(weight)
```

reassign other types and print types:
```
>>> age = 1.5
>>> weight = name
>>> name = 1
>>> age
>>> name
>>> weight
>>> type(age)
>>> type(name)
>>> type(weight)
```

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this behaviour?
