# Homework basic types

### 👨‍💻 TASK 1: My Info Card

Create a small “info card” using variables.

Create the following variables:

name → your name (string)
age → your age (integer)
height → your height in meters (float)
is_student → whether you are a student (boolean)

Print each variable and its type, e.g.:
```
print("Name:", name, "| Type:", type(name))
```

Print a short sentence using your variables, for example:
```
print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my height is {height} meters.")
```

### 👨‍💻 TASK 2: Simple Math Practice

Use integer and float operations.

Create two variables:
a = 15
b = 4

Print the results of:
a + b
a / b
a // b
a ** b

Write a short comment in your code explaining the difference between / and //.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 3: Working with Strings

Create a variable:
```
word = "Python"
```

Do the following:

Print the word in uppercase and lowercase.

Print the first and last letters.

Print the middle three letters using slicing.

Combine two strings, e.g.:

greeting = "Hello"
message = greeting + " " + word + "!"
print(message)

### 👨‍💻 TASK 4: Boolean Logic

Create these variables:

is_sunny = True
is_raining = False

Use comparison operators to print the results of:

10 > 5
3 == 4
bool(0)
bool("")


Predict what each line will print before you run it.


### 👨‍💻 TASK 5: Type Conversion

Try the following:
```
str_num = "100"
num = int(str_num)
print(num + 50)
```

Convert 3.99 to an integer and explain what happens.

What happens if you try int("hello")? Write your prediction as a comment.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 6: Mixed Practice Challenge

Without running the code, predict what will be printed and what the type of each variable will be. Then test it.
```
x = 10 + 3.5
print(type(x))

y = "5" * 3
print(y)
print(type(y))

z = bool("Python")
print(z)
print(type(z))
```

### 👨‍💻 TASK 7: Data Types

What is the difference between an integer (int) and a float (float)?

Which data type would you use to represent:

a person’s name

their age

their height in meters

whether they are a student

What does the value None represent in Python?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 8: Numbers and Operators

What’s the difference between the / and // operators? Give an example.

What does the ** operator do in Python?

If a = 10 and b = 3, what are the results of:

a / b

a // b

a ** b

### 👨‍💻 TASK 9: Strings

What’s the difference between single quotes ' ' and double quotes " " in strings?

What does name[0] return if name = "Alice"?

What is string concatenation? Give an example.

What happens if you try to multiply a string, e.g. "Hi" * 3?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 10: Booleans and Logic

What are the two possible values of a boolean variable?

What is the result of:
```
10 > 5

5 == 5

3 != 4

10 < 2
```
What is the result of bool(0) and bool(""), and why?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 11: Dictionaries

What is a dictionary in Python used for?

In the dictionary person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, what does "name" represent?

How can you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 12: Type Conversion

What happens when you run float(3)?

What happens if you try to run int("hello")? Why?

How do you convert a number to a string in Python?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 13: Type Checking

What is the purpose of the type() function?

What is the difference between type(x) and isinstance(x, int)?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 14: Reflection (Open-ended)

What was the most surprising thing you discovered when testing Python data types?

In your own words, why is it important to understand data types before writing more complex Python programs?
