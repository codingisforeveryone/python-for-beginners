# Homework Operators

### 🛠️ Setup
Open your terminal and start Python:
```
python
```

You should see:
```

```

### 👨‍💻 TASK 1: Simple Math in Python

Define:
```
>>> a = 10
>>> b = 3
```

Print the result of each operation:
```
>>> print("Addition:", a + b)
>>> print("Subtraction:", a - b)
>>> print("Multiplication:", a * b)
>>> print("Division:", a / b)
>>> print("Floor Division:", a // b)
>>> print("Modulus:", a % b)
>>> print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)
```


### 👨‍💻 TASK 2: Experiment with Division

Predict the result before running each of these lines:
```
>>> print(7 / 2)
>>> print(7 // 2)
>>> print(7 / 2)
>>> print(-7 // 2)
```

- Use type() to check the result type of / and //.
- Write a short comment (in your code) explaining:
- The difference between / and //.
- Why -7 // 2 gives a different result than you might expect.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 3: Modulus

Predict the result before running each of these lines:
```
>>> print(10 % 3)
>>> print(12 % 5)
>>> print(5 % 10)
>>> print(-7 % 3)
```

What does the modulus operator (%) actually give you?
What happens when the first number is smaller or negative?

### 👨‍💻 TASK 4: Power and Roots

Predict the result before running each of these lines:

```
>>> print(2 ** 3)
>>> print(5 ** 2)
>>> print(9 ** 0.5)
>>> print(10 ** -1)
```

### 👨‍💻 TASK 5: Order of Operations

Predict the result before running each of these lines:
```
>>> print(10 + 5 * 2)
>>> print((10 + 5) * 2)
>>> print(2 ** 3 + 4 * 2)
>>> print((2 ** 3) + (4 * 2))
```

Run them and compare your predictions.

Add a short explanation of why parentheses change the result.

### 👨‍💻 TASK 6: Mini Challenge

Calculate the following using Python operators:
- The total cost of buying 5 apples that cost 2.5 each.
- The average of the numbers 8, 12, and 20.
- The remainder when 45 is divided by 7.
- The square of 9 using exponentiation.


### 👨‍💻 TASK 7: Quick Questions (Write in Comments or Separate File)

Answer in full sentences:
- What happens when you add an integer and a float in Python?
- What is the difference between / and // in terms of the data type they return?
- What does a % b represent in plain English?
- What is the output of 2 ** 3 ** 2? (Think carefully before testing!)
